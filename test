Datadog Best Practices  
How to effectively use Datadog for monitoring and observability in our systems. This session is aimed at standardizing our telemetry practices, improving system health monitoring, and optimizing performance

Introduction  

Observability is critical in modern engineering, and Datadog is a powerful tool to help us achieve it. Cover best practices across infrastructure monitoring, application performance, real user monitoring, job tracking, and logging.
Standardization Goals  

Our goal is to establish consistent telemetry practices, ensure comprehensive monitoring coverage, and streamline monitoring processes. Standardization across teams helps us create reliable dashboards, reduce redundant alerts, and enhance troubleshooting efficiency.  

Key Dashboards to Maintain  

Datadog provides many monitoring capabilities, but we focus on five key areas:  
- Infrastructure Monitoring – Tracking resource usage on servers, Kubernetes, and cloud instances.  
- Real User Monitoring (RUM) – Capturing user interactions and experience.  
- Application Performance Monitoring (APM) – Monitoring backend services and microservices.  
- Database Monitoring – Identifying slow queries and resource consumption.  
- Job Monitoring – Tracking scheduled tasks and batch processes.  

Infrastructure Monitoring  

Infrastructure monitoring helps us track the health and resource usage of our servers and cloud environments.  
- We need to monitor CPU, memory, network traffic, and disk usage.  
- For Kubernetes, we focus on container-based resource utilization.  
- Alerts should be set up for high CPU, memory, or disk usage to prevent system failures.  

Real User Monitoring (RUM)  

RUM helps us understand how users interact with our applications by tracking session data, page views, and user behavior.  
- It allows us to identify slow-loading pages, frequent errors, and session drop-offs.  
- We can set up anomaly detection to catch suspicious spikes in traffic or failures.  

Application Performance Monitoring (APM)  

APM is crucial for backend and microservices monitoring. It helps with:  
- Performance Optimization – Identifying slow services and endpoints.  
- Error Tracing – Understanding error propagation across distributed systems.  
- Dependency Analysis – Mapping service dependencies for troubleshooting.  

Best practices include:  
- Setting up distributed tracing for visibility into request flow.  
- Defining SLAs for latency and error rates.  
- Configuring alerts for high response times or increased error rates.  

Database Monitoring  

Databases are a common bottleneck, so monitoring them is essential for performance and stability.  
- We track query execution time, resource usage, and availability.  
- Alerts should be set for high disk I/O, slow queries, and low connection availability.  
- Regular maintenance, such as index rebuilding and query optimization, improves database efficiency.  

Job Monitoring  

Most jobs are triggered via AWS Managed Airflow or Control-M, and their statistics are logged in Datadog.  
- We monitor job success rates, runtimes, and resource consumption.  
- Setting alerts for long-running or failed jobs helps identify issues early.  
- Dashboards should visualize trends in job execution to predict failures.  

Log Monitoring  

Logs are invaluable for debugging and troubleshooting. Best practices include:  
- Understanding log processes – Differentiating between log ingestion and indexing.  
- Mastering log queries – Using filters, wildcards, and advanced queries for analysis.  
- Setting up log-based alerts – Triggering notifications on error patterns or spikes.  

Synthetic Monitoring  

Synthetic monitoring lets us simulate user interactions and test service availability.  
- It helps detect downtime and performance issues before real users experience them.  
- Choosing the correct monitoring locations is essential for accurate results.  
- Alerts should be configured for failed checks, high response times, or missing transactions.  

Summary Dashboards & DORA Metrics  

Summary dashboards provide a quick overview of system health.  
- Error rate graphs and test run success rates give a high-level view of system stability.  
- We also track DORA Metrics, which measure software delivery performance:  
  - Deployment Frequency – How often code changes reach production.  
  - Lead Time for Changes – How quickly code moves from commit to deployment.  
  - Mean Time to Restore (MTTR) – How fast incidents are resolved.  

Control-M Datadog Integration  

Our Control-M integration sends job statistics to Datadog, helping us track:  
- Job status breakdown – Success vs. failure rates.  
- Top 10 failed jobs – Identifying recurring issues.  
- Longest running jobs – Finding bottlenecks in job execution.  

Final Thoughts & Next Steps  

In summary, Datadog gives us end-to-end observability, improving system reliability and performance.  
- Start by setting up dashboards and alerts for critical systems.
- Ensure APM, RUM, and log monitoring are correctly configured.  
- Regularly review dashboards and optimize based on trends and alerts.
